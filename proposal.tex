\section{\textbf{Image processing webkit}}
This project aims at bringing the state of the art machine learning usages to the user directly through a web and android app based UI. Today, their are several image processing tools available both on web platform and on android platform but none of them show the current state of the art techniques that have been developed by researchers all around the world. To give a concrete example, the currently available tools will give you the ability to apply filters at an image and similar things, but, the current state of the art can even transfer the style of an image to another image (neural style transfer). The current state of the art techniques can also color a black and white image which was never though to be possible using machine learning a few years before. This has all become possible with the advancements in neural networks. A basic neural network model is shown below.
